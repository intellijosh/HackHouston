# HackHouston
Simple chatbot for HackHouston 2020. To help with last minute questions about the event.
Last year we gave out surveys and the number one thing attendees said were we could have done a better job relaying micro information. To combat that this year, I created a simple chatbot that answers the most repeated questions.
